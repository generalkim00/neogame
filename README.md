Decentralized Lottery

Abstract

Lottery is just a proof of concept of decentralized randomness. This system will take place in two rounds and ensure the winner is chosen completely at random. 

Set Up

To play the lottery, a user needs to have a wallet containing Neo GAS.

First Round

User will fill out a form with 3 pieces of data:

Pick a number of 1 byte (0-255).
Amount of GAS required for the total number of entry tickets they wish to purchase
Their public key.

Once done, the user clicks “submit” and then needs to approve the transaction for the amount used to purchase the lottery ticket in their neo wallet client. 

(ex. 1 GAS = 1 entry)

Once transaction is approved the user’s computer will generate a random number through our client. This number will be generated by hashing (Picked number, public key, system time) to produce a random number within the same range as the user’s picked number. 

The random number generated is referred to as the “Hidden Number”. The system will now hash the hidden number with an open-source algorithm and produce a function referred to as the “Hash of Hidden Number”

Then 5 pieces of information are submitted onto the chain. 

Game ID
Player’s public key (PK)
Player’s picked number
Amount of GAS paid
Hash of Hidden Number

Once the first round is completed, the system closes submission any new entries to the chain. No more lottery tickets will be sold. 

Second Round

All hidden numbers are posted to the chain from the user’s wallet with the following data:

Game ID
Hidden number

Determining the Winner

This ensures the user remains anonymous. Then the average of all the hidden numbers is used to determine the winner of the lottery by matching the hidden number average with the winning picked number by a user.

To match the number with the user, the winning number is hashed through the open algorithm, and if a user’s  Hash of Hidden Number matched, the proceeds of the lottery are sent to their public key submitted with their original entry. 

Check(gameID, playerAddress, hashOfHiddenNumber)

Conclusion

The goal of this lottery is to run a completely decentralized system which creates randomness based on user submission. By leveraging the anonymity of the lottery numbers submitted, a system can perform a calculation on these numbers and determine the winner without any bias.
